# Arrays

An array in JavaScript is a data structure that stores an ordered list of elements. It can hold elements of any data type, including numbers, string, objects, and even other arrays. Arrays are a type of object in JavaScript and have a number of built-in methods for adding, removing, and manipulating elements.

## What do we need Arrays in JavaScript?

* Grouping related data
* Storing large amount of data
* Improving performance
* Ease of use
* Better readability

# Introduction to Function

The concept of function came into existence to support the way we organize and structure code. A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be reused throughout the program.

This allows us to write more efficient and modular code, as well as the ability to easily update or change the behavior of the program by modifying the functions. Additionally, by using functions we can make the code more readable and easier to understand.

Some functions will be in-build in javascript which can be directly used and some must be user-defined functions. We will be looking into them in further lectures.

## In JavaScript, Functions are first-class citizens.

Functions in JavaScript are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from function.

## Parameters, Argument & Return Statement.

A parameter is a variable that is declared within the parentheses of the function declaration. It serves as a placeholder or a refernce for the input value that will be passed to the function when it is called.

Parameters are dummy names we pass/give a function when we are declaring a function.
